# Documentation

Start with the directories below and expand them as the product evolves:

- [Product overview](product/overview.md): market framing, use cases, and roadmap.
- [Architecture](architecture/system-overview.md): component interactions and technical decisions.
- [Brand guide](brand/style-guide.md): voice, visuals, and review checklist.

Use additional markdown files or subfolders to capture specs, ADRs, and research notes.
