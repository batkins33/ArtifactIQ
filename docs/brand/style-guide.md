# Brand Style Guide

## Positioning

ArtifactIQ pairs cultural heritage expertise with assistive AI. The brand should feel trusted, meticulous, and quietly modern.

## Voice principles

- Write with confidence and respect for cultural significance.
- Keep sentences concise; avoid jargon unless it supports domain accuracy.
- Favor active voice and specific verbs (identify, preserve, verify).

## Visual identity

- **Primary colors** (from the web demo):
  - Midnight background: `#0B0F13`
  - Accent blue: `#3AA0FF`
  - Ice foreground: `#E7EDF3`
  - Slate muted text: `#9FB0C0`
- **Typography**: Use a clean sans-serif stack (e.g., Inter, Segoe UI) and a monospace accent for identifiers.
- **Imagery**: Showcase artifacts in neutral lighting with minimal props. When using AI-generated imagery, label it clearly.

## Usage guidelines

- Reserve the accent blue for interactive elements or key highlights.
- Maintain at least 16px padding inside cards and panels to echo the demo spacing.
- Keep layouts uncluttered; pair dark backgrounds with high-contrast text for accessibility.
- Attribute artifact sources and cultural context wherever assets appear.

## Review checklist

1. Does the copy reinforce preservation, authenticity, and collaboration?
2. Are brand colors applied consistently with accessible contrast ratios?
3. Are artifacts credited and contextualized?
